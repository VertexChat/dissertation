Abstract = {Information technologies give patients the opportunity to communicate with medical professionals remotely. Telemedicine uses these technologies to provide advanced healthcare and medical services. We present a medical online consultation application based on Web Real-Time Communications (WebRTC) technology enabling chat, audio, and video calls. Communication architecture and protocols of the application are explained in detail. Additionally, the user interface of the application is shown via performed calls. The application is tested and evaluated on different network connections (3G, 4G, local, and DSL) and different browsers and mobile operating systems (Android, Chrome, Firefox, Internet Explorer, iOS, Opera, Safari). During calls, communication quality parameters such as round-trip time (RTT) and packet loss, obtained via the WebRTC application programming interface, are analyzed. 3G, 4G, and local connections show low packet losses (<1%). Packet losses are high (>1%) in Android, },

% Brief article about WebRTC in Medicine - Ref 4
@article{S187705091632345620160101,
Abstract = {ICT in healthcare businesses has been growing in Portugal in the past few decades. The implementation of large scale information systems in hospitals, the deployment of electronic prescription and electronic patient records applications are just a few examples. Telemedicine is another emergent and widely used ICT solution to smooth the communication between patients and healthcare professionals, by allowing video and voice transfer over the Internet. Although there are several implementations of telemedicine solutions, they usually have some drawbacks, namely: i) too specific for a purpose; ii) based on proprietary applications; iii) require additional software installation; iv) and usually have associated costs.In this paper we propose a telemedicine solution based on WebRTC Application Programming Interface (API) to transmit video and voice in real time over the Internet, through a web browser. Besides microphone and webcam control, we have also included two additional functionaliti},

The comparison is in terms of Database response time. Their performance is compared using a common CRUD operations. Each operations data is analyzed using Wilcoxon Signed-Rank test. Our comparison results confirm that Firebase Realtime Database is more suitable as our Daily Nutritional Needs Mobile Application Database Management System since it could perform better response time. The key features match our needs to provide Realtime Data and it is also help simplify the process of developing applications."

Abstract = {The research presented in this paper introduces Rendez-Vous, which is a system oriented to provide its users with a greater communication availability through the convergence of the conventional telephony and the real-time multimedia on the web browsers. The system consists on a web application that provides a videoconference room for multiple users without having to download any additional software. For the cases in which a user with no internet connection might need to participate in a conference, it is possible to dial and answer phone calls to/from the PSTN directly on the web browser, allowing the telephonic user to interact with the others using his/her voice. The aim of the present project is to propose a unified communications system that differs from others mainly in the interaction with the telephone network directly from a web browser while having an active videoconference, allowing real-time exchange of media streams between these two technologies.

Abstract = {In this paper, we presented issues, challenges, and solutions of videoconference system for rural education. First, we discussed several issues on the implementation of videoconference system for education, particulary in rural area in Indonesia, which covered videoconference requirement, rural condition, and education needs. Second, we presented several challenges consisted of choosing videoconference technology, choosing compression method, system and application development, ensuring quality of services, and ensuring quality of experiences. Based on the issues and challenges, we proposed a solution of videoconference system which is specifically deployed in rural education. The solution was based on WebRTC technology implemented in Intel i5 core miniPC choosen to increase portability of the system.
